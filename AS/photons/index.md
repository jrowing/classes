# Monochromatic light, two-source interference and photons.

## Aims:
1. the idea that coherent sources are monochromatic with wavefronts continuous across the width of the beam and, (when comparing
more than one source) with a constant phase relationship 
2. examples of coherent and incoherent sources
3. the idea that for two source interference to be observed, the sources must have a zero or constant phase difference and have oscillations in the same direction

## Coherence 

This is an essential condition for the interference of waves.
Two sources of waves are described as coherent if they emit waves
with a constant phase difference (note that the waves do not necessarily
have to be in phase). 

Two waves arriving at a point are said to be
coherent if there is a constant phase difference between them as they
pass that point.


## Interference

Interference cannot be observed with light - or any form of electromagnetic
radiation - from two separate light sources. This is because
the phase difference between light waves from the two sources
changes randomly and rapidly so the points of cancellation and reinforcement
move about at random. The two sets of waves need to be produced
from a single source, either:

* by dividing the wavefront and arranging for the divided wavefronts to overlap, as in the double slit experiment 
* dividing the amplitude of the waves using a partial reflector and arranging for the separated waves to overlap, as in thin film interference.

## Path difference and Interference
One way of demonstrating interference effects is to take a single source of waves and allow the waves to travel by two different
paths to a detector. The difference in the distance that the wave travels in the two paths is called the "path-difference" and this term will crop up a lot as we look at some of the classic experiments.
