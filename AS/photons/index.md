# Definitions:
*A wave* is a means of transferring energy and momentum from one point to another without there being any transfer of matter between the two points.
## Mechanical
Mechanical waves are made up of particles vibrating e.g. sound – air molecules; water – water molecules All these waves require a substance for transmission and so none of them can travel through a vacuum.
## Electromagnetic
Electromagnetic waves are made up of oscillating electric and magnetic fields. e.g. light and radio These waves do not require a substance for transmission and so all of them can travel through a vacuum.
## Progressive
Progressive waves are waves where there is a net transfer of energy and momentum from one point to another. e.g. sound produced by a person speaking; light from a lamp
## Stationary
Stationary waves are waves where there is a NO net transfer of energy and momentum from one point to another. e.g. the wave on a guitar string
## Longitudinal
Longitudinal waves are waves where the direction of vibration of the particles is parallel to the direction in which the wave travels. e.g. sound
## Transverse
Transverse waves are waves where the direction of vibration of the particles or fields is perpendicular to the direction in which the wave travels. e.g. water and all electromagnetic waves Test for a transverse wave: Only TRANVERSE waves undergo polarisation.
## Measuring Waves
Displacement, x This is the distance of an oscillating particle from its undisturbed or equilibrium position. Amplitude, a This is the maximum displacement of an oscillating particle from its equilibrium position. It is equal to the height of a peak or the depth of a trough. Wavelength, λ This is the distance between two consecutive particles at the same phase. Example: top-of-a-peak to the next top-of-a-peak unit – metre, m Period, T This is equal to the time taken for one complete oscillation in of a particle in a wave. unit – second, s Frequency, f This is equal to the number of complete oscillations in one second performed by a particle in a wave. unit – hertz, Hz	NOTE: f = 1 / T Phase, φ This is the point that a particle is at within an oscillation. Examples: ‘top of peak’, ‘bottom of trough’ Phase is sometimes expressed in terms of an angle up to 360°. If the top of a peak is 0° then the bottom of a trough will be 180°.

# The Wave Speed equation:
For all waves:
$$speed (m/s)=frequency (/s)×wavelength (m)$$
$$c=fλ$$

# Superposition of waves
A simple wave 
$$ A=A0sinωt+ϕ $$
